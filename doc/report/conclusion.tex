\section{Forecast and Conclusion}
\label{hd007}
EasyOCaml in version 0.5 is not yet full ready for action. For version 
1.0, we will add installation procedures for language levels and 
teachpacks. Furthermore, we will equip the errors with more informations 
such that error reporting plugins can use certain heuristics to give 
hints how to fix an error (i.e. one could take a look into the 
variable environment to check misspellings in unbound variable errors). 
In a long term, a dynamically typed interpreter would be great for the very
first lessons in programming without the need to think about types as well as
support for module declarations to make EasyOCaml ready for application in our
daily programming.


\subsection{Acknowledgements}
\label{hd007001}
This project was found in the \emph{OCaml Summer Project 2008}. So 
thanks to the people at Jane Street Capital for this initiative! I would like
to thank Prof. Peter Thiemann and his team, especially Stefan Wehr, very much
for mentoring me, giving invaluable hints and guiding me through EasyOCaml.
