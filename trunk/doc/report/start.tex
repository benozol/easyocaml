\begin{abstract}
  \ocaml\ is not a language well suited for beginners or teaching programming,
  because without some practice error messages are sometimes hard to understand.
  \easyocaml\ equips the \ocaml\ system with a new type checker for a reasonable
  subset of the \ocaml\ language and an adapted parser to make error messages
  more descriptive.
  Plugins for reporting errors can be loaden at runtime to produce output for
  different settings.  Error messages are internationalized.
  Furthermore, \easyocaml\ adds language levels and teach packs to make the
  language a good choice for teaching programming.
  All this is integrated in the original \ocaml\ system. 

  This report describes the ideas as well as the formal and notional
  foundations of \easyocaml.
  It should serve as a introduction and manual for users and as a guide to the
  foundations for further development.
