\begin{abstract}
  OCaml is not a language well suited for beginners or teaching programming,
  because error messages are sometimes hard to understand without some practice.
  EasyOCaml\footnote{\href{http://easyocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org}{http://easyocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org}}
  equips the OCaml system with a new type checker for a reasonable subset of the
  OCaml language and an adapted parser to make error messages more
  descriptive. Plugins for reporting errors can be loaded at runtime, to produce
  output for different settings. Furthermore, EasyOCaml adds language levels and
  teach packs (similar to those of DrScheme) to make the language a good choice
  for teaching programming. All this is integrated in the original OCaml system. 

  This report describes the formal and notional foundations of EasyOCaml and
  its implementation as a manual and guide to further development.
