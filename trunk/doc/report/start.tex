\begin{abstract}
  \ocaml\ is not a language well suited for beginners or teaching programming,
  because error messages are sometimes hard to understand without some
  practice.
  \easyocaml\ equips the OCaml system with a new type checker for a reasonable
  subset of the \ocaml\ language and an adapted parser to make error messages
  more descriptive.
  Plugins for reporting errors can be loaded at runtime, to produce output for
  different settings.
  Furthermore, \easyocaml\ adds language levels and teach packs (similar to
  those of \textsl{DrScheme}) to make the language a good choice for teaching
  programming.
  All this is integrated in the original OCaml system. 

  This report describes the ideas and formal and notional foundations of
  \easyocaml\ as well as its implementation as a manual and guide to further
  development.
