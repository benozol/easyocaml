\section{Forecast and Conclusion}

\easyocaml\ in version 0.5 is not yet completely ready for action. For version 
1.0, we will add installation procedures for language levels and 
teachpacks.
Furthermore, we will equip the errors with more informations such that error
reporting plugins can use certain heuristics to give hints how to fix an error
(i.e. to pass the currnt variable environment to unbound variable errors to
check misspellings).
In a long term, a dynamically typed interpreter would be great for the very
first lessons in programming without the need to think about types, as well as
the support for module declarations to make \easyocaml\ ready for our daily
programming.

This project was funded by the \emph{OCaml Summer Project 2008}.
So thanks to the people at Jane Street Capital for this initiative and to
make \easyocaml\ possible!
I am deeply grateful to Prof.\ Peter Thiemann and his team---especially Stefan
Wehr---for mentoring and guiding me through the course of \easyocaml.
